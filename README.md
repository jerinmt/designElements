# designElements
A repository containing javascript modules of various design features to be used with html and css.

This repository will contain individual features that I create which can be reused. First I will create a dropdown menu and an image carousel as part of my Odin Project course, then gradually will add others that I make.

1) Dropdown menu - dropdownMaker()
    To use this write the html for a button and a div that contains the menu elements. Then put the two inside a div container and give it a class name common for all dropdowns. Use this function and pass the classname as argument. 
    Eg. if the div has a class name of XYZ, call dropdownMaker('XYZ') after adding the module.
    Then add whatever styling you need in CSS.
